# My Smart-Contract Auditor & Engineer Plan
This plan is to become a smart contract auditor in 2024.

## Steps
1. Learn about the EVM - ‚úÖ
2. Practice solidity by building Projects and Reading Codebases - Inprogress üéØ
3. Read and understand the most used Defi/Blockchain protocols eg. (Uniswap, and Chainlink).
4. Smart Contract security best practices and common vulnerabilities.
5. Solve CTFs
6. Report Reading
7. Get real-world experience in auditing

## Bootcamps
* Take Cyfrin smart contract security course.
* Take Guardian audits Playlist.
   

## Tips
* Aim to have ‚Äúreal-life security experience‚Äù in audit contests or bug bounties as fast as possible.
* Learn by doing.
* For solidity projects try replicating existing codebases without copying
* Understanding a protocol before auditing is crucial.
* There's the Understanding phase || Then the auditing phase.
* Stay in one contest at a time.
* There is always something to find.
* Success is not overnight, learn to be patient and don't compare yourself.
* Make sure that you're improving.
* Track your results.

## Learning Solidity In-depth - Original Project Ideas
To be a great Solidity dev, one must deeply understand the EVM.

### * Read Solidity Docs

1. Decentralized Voting System :
Create a decentralized voting system where users can cast votes on various proposals. Ensure transparency and security through blockchain technology.

2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol:
Develop a simple DeFi protocol like a decentralized lending or borrowing platform. Implement features like creating loans, earning interest, and handling collateral.

3. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace:
Create an NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Consider adding features like auctions, royalties, and categorization.

4. Supply chain management :
Implement a blockchain-based supply chain management system. Use smart contracts to trace the origin and journey of products through the supply chain.

5. Escrow Service:
Develop a decentralized escrow service for secure transactions. Users can lock funds in escrow, and the release is contingent on predefined conditions

6. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):
Implement a DAO where members can vote on proposals to make decisions collectively. Explore features like staking, voting weights, and proposal creation.

## Learning The EVM.
1. Read Noxx and Andreas EVM Deep dives ‚úÖ
2. Watch Peter Robinson - Solidity to Bytecode, Memory & Storage By Ethereum Engineering ‚úÖ
3. Understand Ethereum Smart Contract Storage.
4. Check out EVM Codes - EVM Playground for Opcodes.
5. Practice with EVM Puzzles
6. Marek Kirejczyk - Ethereum Under The Hood
