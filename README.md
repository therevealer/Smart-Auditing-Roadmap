# My Smart-Contract Auditor & Engineer Plan
This plan is to become a smart contract auditor & engineer in 2024.

## Steps
1. Practice solidity by building Projects - InProgress üéØ
2. Learn about the EVM - InProgress üéØ
3. Understand common smart contract standards and proposals(ERCs and EIPs).
4. Become familiar with the most used smart contracts eg Uniswap, Chainlink.
5. Smart Contract security best practices and common vulnerabilities.
6. Solve CTFs
7. Defi deep dive & and common vulnerabilities.
8. Report Reading
9. Get real-world experience

## Bootcamps
* Take Cyfrin smart contract security course.
   

## Tips
* Aim to have ‚Äúreal-life security experience‚Äù in audit contests or bug bounties as fast as possible.
* Learn by doing.
* For solidity projects try replicating existing codebases without copying
* Understanding a protocol before auditing is crucial.
* There's the Understanding phase || Then the auditing phase.
* Stay in one contest at a time.
* There is always something to find.
* Success is not overnight, learn to be patient and don't compare yourself.
* Make sure that you're improving.
* Track your results.

## Learning Solidity In-depth - Original Project Ideas
1. Decentralized Voting System :
Create a decentralized voting system where users can cast votes on various proposals. Ensure transparency and security through blockchain technology.
Tokenization Platform:

2. Tokenization Platform :
Build a platform for tokenizing assets, such as real estate, art, or other physical assets. Users should be able to create, buy, and trade tokenized assets.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol:

3. Defi Protocol :
Develop a simple DeFi protocol, such as a decentralized lending or borrowing platform. Implement features like creating loans, earning interest, and handling collateral.
Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace:

4. NFT MarketPlace :
Create an NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Consider adding features like auctions, royalties, and categorization.
Supply Chain Management:

5. Supply chain management :
Implement a blockchain-based supply chain management system. Use smart contracts to trace the origin and journey of products through the supply chain.
Decentralized Identity Management:

6. Decentralized identity :
Build a decentralized identity management system where users control their personal data. Explore concepts like self-sovereign identity.
Escrow Service:

7. Escrow :
Develop a decentralized escrow service for secure transactions. Users can lock funds in escrow, and the release is contingent on predefined conditions.
Blockchain-based Game:

8. Gaming :
Create a simple blockchain-based game where in-game assets are represented as tokens on the blockchain. Consider integrating NFTs for unique in-game items.
Charity Donation Platform:

9. Donation Platform :
Build a transparent charity donation platform where users can donate funds to charitable causes. Use blockchain to ensure transparency in fund allocation.
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):

10. DAO :
Implement a DAO where members can vote on proposals to make decisions collectively. Explore features like staking, voting weights, and proposal creation.
Decentralized Messaging App:

11. Decentralized Messaging :
Create a decentralized messaging application where messages are stored on a blockchain for security and privacy. Implement end-to-end encryption.
Subscription-based Content Platform:

12. Decentralized Content :
Develop a content platform where users can offer and subscribe to premium content using cryptocurrency. Smart contracts handle subscription payments and content access.
