# My Smart-Contract Auditor & Engineer Plan
This plan is to become a smart contract auditor & engineer in 2024.

## Steps
1. Practice solidity by building Projects - InProgress 🎯
2. Learn about the EVM - InProgress 🎯
3. Understand common smart contract standards and proposals(ERCs and EIPs).
4. Become familiar with the most used smart contracts eg Uniswap, Chainlink.
5. Smart Contract security best practices and common vulnerabilities.
6. Solve CTFs
7. Defi deep dive & and common vulnerabilities.
8. Report Reading
9. Get real-world experience

## Bootcamps
* Take Cyfrin smart contract security course.
   

## Tips
* Aim to have “real-life security experience” in audit contests or bug bounties as fast as possible.
* Learn by doing.
* For solidity projects try replicating existing codebases without copying
* Understanding a protocol before auditing is crucial.
* There's the Understanding phase || Then the auditing phase.
* Stay in one contest at a time.
* There is always something to find.
* Success is not overnight, learn to be patient and don't compare yourself.
* Make sure that you're improving.
* Track your results.

## Learning Solidity In-depth - Original Project Ideas
To be a great Solidity dev one must have a deep understanding of the EVM.

### * Read Solidity Docs

1. Decentralized Voting System :
Create a decentralized voting system where users can cast votes on various proposals. Ensure transparency and security through blockchain technology.

2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol:
Develop a simple DeFi protocol like a decentralized lending or borrowing platform. Implement features like creating loans, earning interest, and handling collateral.

3. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace:
Create an NFT marketplace where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Consider adding features like auctions, royalties, and categorization.

4. Supply chain management :
Implement a blockchain-based supply chain management system. Use smart contracts to trace the origin and journey of products through the supply chain.

5. Escrow Service:
Develop a decentralized escrow service for secure transactions. Users can lock funds in escrow, and the release is contingent on predefined conditions

6. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):
Implement a DAO where members can vote on proposals to make decisions collectively. Explore features like staking, voting weights, and proposal creation.

## Learning The EVM.
1. Read Noxx and Andreas EVM Deep dives.
2. Watch Peter Robinson - Solidity to Bytecode, Memory & Storage By Ethereum Engineering.
3. Understand Ethereum Smart Contract Storage.
4. Check out EVM Codes - EVM Playground for Opcodes.
5. Practice with EVM Puzzles
6. Marek Kirejczyk - Ethereum Under The Hood
