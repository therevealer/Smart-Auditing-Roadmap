This plan is to become a smart contract auditor/hacker in 2024, but I have to go through a process that includes learning frontend engineering and getting a Job as a smart contract developer.

## Goal
1. Learn Data structures with Javascript.
2. Learn TailwindCSS.
3. Build Javascript Projects.
4. Learn ReactJs.
5. Learn Solidity In-depth.
6. Start a Blog on Smart-Contract Dev & Security.
